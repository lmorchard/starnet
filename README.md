# Stellar Ansible

This might be [an interstellar hacking game](https://notes.lmorchard.com/Starnet.html), someday.

For now, it's kind of code doodles and sketches loosely stumbling in that direction.

## To Do

* Add multiple drawing layers to WebGL renderer - for HUD, varying brightness levels, etc
* Play with adding some effects like plasma and starry-eye particles
* Implement node types and per-node actions
* Play with [Flume](https://flume.dev/) or [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to manually design network puzzle machines?
* Explore procedurally generating puzzle machines
* Explore Storylets and [Quality-Based Narrative](https://emshort.blog/category/quality-based-narrative/) system for storytelling.
* Integrate [SunVox JS player](https://www.warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/jsplay/) into engine for soundtrack
